# Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model
WRF is a state-of-the-art atmospheric modeling system designed for both meteorological research and numerical weather prediction. It offers a host of options for atmospheric processes and can run on a variety of computing platforms. WRF excels in a broad range of applications across scales ranging from tens of meters to thousands of kilometers. For more information, check out: (https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/)

The namelist.wps and namelist.input files are used for running the WRF Preprocessing system (which includes geogrid.exe, ungrib.exe, and metgrid.exe) and the WRF model itself (which includes real.exe, wrf.exe, tc.exe, and ndown.exe). Multiple columns are used for multiple domains; however max_domains determines how many columns will be used. For example, if you use 3 columns, but only set max_dom = 2, the last column will be ignored.
NOTE: Not all parameters have mulitple columns.
